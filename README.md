# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: Purpose and background of this analysis.

Steve, who rencently graduated with his finance degree, has asked me to assist him on analysis of a handful of green energy stocks for his parent's, who will be his first client. Steve has created an Excel file containing the stock data he wants us to analyze. I will be using an extension in Excel built for automating tasks, called Visual Basic for Application (VBA). VBA is able to make calculations, and use complex logic to perform analysis on the stock data. I will do analysis on two measures of the stock; 1) how actively stock was traded (daily volume) and 2) percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning to the end of the year (yearly return). Additionally, I used the VBA code to automate the analysis which in the future, will allow Steve to do analysis with any stock.


## Results: 
### Stock performance between 2017 and 2018

Only two of the twelve green stocks carried positive returns with them into 2018 from 2017. Those were tickers RUN (83.95% return) and ENPH (81.92%).The total daily volume for both those stocks increased from 2017 to 2018. Stock ticker DQ, who Steve's parents originally wanted to look at dropped significanly in 2018 (-62.60%) from its 2017 return (199.45%).
