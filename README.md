# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose and background of this analysis.

Steve, who rencently graduated with his finance degree, has asked us to assist him on analysis of a handful of green energy stocks for his parent's, who will be his first client. Steve has created an Excel file containing the stock data he wants us to analyze. I will be using an extension in Excel built for automating tasks, called Visual Basic for Application (VBA). VBA is able to make calculations, and use complex logic to perform analysis on the stock data. Additionally, I used the code
to automate the analysis which in the future, will allow Steve to do analysis with any stock.
